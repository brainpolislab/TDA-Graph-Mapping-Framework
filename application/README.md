## **Mapping framework application**
The present application is utilized to validate the framework, involving the white matter brain features of a cohort comprising 1109 healthy subjects. The two tasks addressed by this application include predicting sex, a categorical variable, and total intracranial volume, a continuous variable. Concerning the Mapper algorithm, the following parameters were employed: _n_cubes_ = 20 and _perc_overlap_ = 0.6. For clustering, DBSCAN was utilized with _min_samples_ = 3 and _eps_ = 32.
