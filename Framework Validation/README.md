# Mapping Framework Validation
The Mapping Framework has been developed and vallidated with consideration for fMRI data from specific subjects. However, it is adaptable and extendable to accomodate diverse types of datasets, contingent upon the rewuirements and scope of the study project.

### Dataset
The dataset included in this repository comprises information about 587 subjects. Each subject is characterized by fMRI feature data, specifically the connectivity matrix associated with Dosenbach's atlas (160x160 matrix). Furthermore, each subject is assigned a class label indicating the diagnosis. The distribution of diagnoses is as follows: 251 Healthy Control (HC) subjects, 119 Recent Onset Psychosis (ROP) subjects, 111 Recent Onset Depression (ROD) subjects, and 106 Clinical High-Risk (CHR) subjects.
