# TDA-Graph-Mapping-Framework
Topological Data Analysis (TDA) graphs represent a formidable mathematical framework for elucidating the intricate structure and relationships inherent in intricate datasets. Derived from principles in algebraic topology, TDA graphs possess a unique capacity to unveil nuanced patterns and features that may elude conventional data analysis methodologies, particularly in handling high-dimensional and noisy datasets.  

An interesting application involves the **mapping of new data samples within a pre-constructed TDA graph**. This mapping framework within TDA represents a noteworthy innovation, enabling the seamless integration of new data samples into pre-existing TDA graphs for the sophisticated analysis of complex datasets. This approach yields profound insights into the relationships, similarities, and disparities between newly introduced data and established topological structures. Particularly advantageous in scenarios necessitating a nuanced understanding of evolving data landscapes, the mapping framework enhances the adaptability of TDA graphs, rendering it a potent tool for applications such as pattern recognition, classification, and anomaly detection.  
In the context of **personalized medicine**, this innovative TDA application holds substantial promise, facilitating the integration of patient-specific data into TDA graphs for tailored health profiles. By discerning intricate patterns within high-dimensional patient data, this approach facilitates precise diagnostics and the formulation of personalized treatment strategies, contributing to more accurate disease profiling and revolutionizing personalized therapeutic interventions for optimized healthcare delivery.

## How the Mapping Framework works?
The Mapping Framework concentrates on the initial two steps of the Mapper algorithm: **Filtering** and **Covering**. The Filtering operation plays a pivotal role in the transformation of original data for topological analysis. It employs a filter (lens) function to project high-dimensional data points into a more compact representation, aligning with specific analysis objectives and data attributes. On the other hand, the Covering operation simplifies high-dimensional data by segmenting it into overlapping bins, each linked to a node in the TDA graph. This meticulous process, regulated by _resolution_ and _gain_ parameters, captures local structures, thereby augmenting the Mapper algorithm capability to comprehend intricate data topology.

### Pipeline
**1. TDA graph creation**  
Construct a TDA graph from an initial dataset of samples using the Mapper algorithm. Utilize various dimensionality reduction techniques to project the initial data into a lower-dimensional space, usually 2D. Keep each transformation for subsequent reuse, facilitating the projection of new samples into established spatial representation obtained through these techniques.
